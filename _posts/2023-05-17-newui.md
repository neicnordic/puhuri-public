<h2>A Revitalized User Experience</h2>
<p>We've always been committed to making your interaction with Puhuri Portals enjoyable, and this update takes it a step further. The new user interface was built keeping you in mind, focusing on ensuring faster navigation to your most important tasks. We've decluttered the interface, prioritizing key tasks and features, so you can get to what you need in less time, with less effort.</p>
<h2>Making the Transition</h2>
<p>We understand that change can sometimes be daunting. However, we've taken measures to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible for you. The new interface has been available as an 'opt-in' feature for some time now, allowing users to try it and provide valuable feedback. This has helped us refine and improve the design, making sure it's ready for prime time.</p>
<p>Starting from the 22nd of May, the new interface will become the default on Puhuri Portals. But rest assured, we're not forcing anyone into the new experience. If you prefer the classic interface, it will still be available, ensuring that you can work in the environment you're most comfortable with.</p>
<h2>Your Feedback is Our Strength</h2>
<p>Puhuri's user community feedback and suggestions have always played a significant role in shaping this new interface. If you have any more suggestions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to listen, adapt, and improve.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon...</h2>
<p>We can't wait for you to experience the new Puhuri Portals interface. It's been designed with our users at its heart, providing a fresh, intuitive, and mobile-friendly platform that enhances your productivity and efficiency. We're confident you'll appreciate the improvements, and as always, we're eager to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the 22nd of May, and get ready to explore Puhuri Portals in a whole new light.</p>
