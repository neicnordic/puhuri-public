<p>We've always been committed to making your interaction with Puhuri Portals enjoyable, and this update takes it a step further. The new user interface was built keeping you in mind, focusing on ensuring faster navigation to your most important tasks. We've decluttered the interface, prioritizing key tasks and features, so you can get to what you need in less time, with less effort.</p>
<h2>Making the Transition</h2>
<p>We understand that change can sometimes be daunting. However, we've taken measures to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible for you. The new interface has been available as an 'opt-in' feature for some time now, allowing users to try it and provide valuable feedback. This has helped us refine and improve the design, making sure it's ready for prime time.</p>
<p>Starting from the 22nd of May, the new interface will become the default on Puhuri Portals. But rest assured, we're not forcing anyone into the new experience. If you prefer the classic interface, it will still be available, ensuring that you can work in the environment you're most comfortable with.</p>
<h2>Your Feedback is Our Strength</h2>
<p>Puhuri's user community feedback and suggestions have always played a significant role in shaping this new interface. If you have any more suggestions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to listen, adapt, and improve.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon...</h2>
<p>We can't wait for you to experience the new Puhuri Portals interface. It's been designed with our users at its heart, providing a fresh, intuitive, and mobile-friendly platform that enhances your productivity and efficiency. We're confident you'll appreciate the improvements, and as always, we're eager to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the 22nd of May, and get ready to explore Puhuri Portals in a whole new light.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Puhuri" /><category term="Puhuri Portal" /><category term="UI" /><category term="Interface" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the 22nd of May, Puhuri Portals will be unveiling a new, modernized user interface - one that's more intuitive, sleek, and mobile-friendly than ever before]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LUMI chooses Puhuri as an allocation platform</title><link href="/2022/03/02/lumi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LUMI chooses Puhuri as an allocation platform" /><published>2022-03-02T10:40:30+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-02T10:40:30+00:00</updated><id>/2022/03/02/lumi</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/03/02/lumi.html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of 2021, the LUMI consortium countries gained access to the LUMI supercomputer in Kajaani, Finland. LUMI is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. At full capacity, LUMI can perform more than 550 quadrillions (million billion) calculations per second, this equals the power of 1.5 million personal computers. At the same time, LUMI is one of the most environmentally friendly supercomputers in the world, as it uses only hydroelectric power. The heat generated during the operation of the powerful processors is used to heat the city of Kajaani. In addition, it is important to note that up to 20% of a new supercomputer's resources are for commercial use. It follows that, in addition to solving scientific problems, LUMI also plays an important role in improving the competitiveness of the European economy.</p>

<p>In order to allow users to access the new supercomputer, the resource management solution Puhuri was developed. This solution is based on Waldur software developed by the specialists at the UT High-Performace Computing Center. Puhuri service consists of three components. The first component is the web portal, through which applications for the use of resources are submitted and approved. If necessary, LUMI consortium members can connect the already existing national portals with the Puhuri solution, e.g. in the case of Estonia and Sweden. Another component is the authentication and authorization infrastructure MyAccessID, which allows secure identification of users through local academic organizations or national authentication services. The final main Puhuri component is an application interface that acts as a central database of information between the supercomputer and the portals, containing information about projects, users and resources involved.</p>

<p>The Puhuri solution developed for LUMI is relatively easy to apply to other supercomputers as well. Therefore, it is planned to offer Puhuri's solution for other supercomputers managed by the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) in the future. The Puhuri solution will also be used in the coming NeIC NordIQuEst project, which aims to build a cloud of quantum computers. Puhuri is a ready-to-use service that saves time and money on creating ad hoc solutions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="LUMI" /><category term="Puhuri" /><category term="CSC" /><category term="EuroHPC" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puhuri’s first use case - LUMI supercomputer]]></summary></entry></feed>
